It has more than file
but you need to just edit index.php form with your midification and coverpage.php with your modification but under the <div id="root"> you need to all edit for your pdf.

Size: A4

You can change any where in file but dont touth js file and under js folder and dont touth any another css must #roo id but you can change any css and make multi file and multi paper size from edit coverpage.php below you find this size. Multi size paper and multi file with multi form or another data you can make this pdf.

thank you.
